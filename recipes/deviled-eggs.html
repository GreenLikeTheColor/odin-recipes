        <h3 class="subtitle description">Description:</h3>
        <p>This is an example of a recipe that really starts to play around with the blending of ingredients that are crucial for different cultures,” says Cohen. “I am just obsessed with Urfa biber. It’s got that same spice and smoke and warmth (as smoked paprika). It’s almost smouldering. And to me, the idea of smoky, sweet, tangy, spicy, fatty … that’s devilled eggs.</p>
        
        <h3 class="subtitle">Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp ground Urfa biber</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup minced fresh chives</li>
            <li>1 celery stalk, minced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and fill a medium bowl with ice and water.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, lay the eggs carefully on the bottom of the pot of boiling water. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook for 12 minutes. Using the slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to the bowl of ice water and let cool for 5 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>Peel the eggs and slice each in half, transferring the yolks to a medium bowl and the whites to a platter, cut-side up.</li>
            <li>Using a potato masher or the back of a fork, mash the egg yolks. Stir in the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, paprika and Urfa biber until smooth. Season with salt.</li>
            <li>Transfer the yolk mixture to a piping bag fitted with a star piping tip. Fill each egg white with about 2 tablespoons of the filling. (Alternatively, transfer the filling to a resealable plastic bag and snip off one corner to pipe, or just simply spoon the yolk mixture into the whites.)</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the chives and celery over the devilled eggs, then garnish each with a pinch of paprika and serve.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>This recipe is a great way to use more blackberries, which are starting to reach their peak season in the summer! This recipe uses naan bread as a flatbread, and it perfect for one person.</p>
        <p>Melting the blackberries, goat cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette produce a melt in your mouth bite that pairs perfectly with some prosciutto and arugula. Eat it alone as a sweet and savory lunch, or make multiple and cut them up for a charcuterie board. The possibilities are endless!</p>
